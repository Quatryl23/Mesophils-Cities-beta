# Mesophils Cities beta source code

Note: This is the repository containing the source code of Mesophil´s Cities´s beta versions.
If you´re looking for the bug tracker or the wiki, visit the [main repository](https://github.com/Quatryl23/Mesophils-cities) of Mesophil´s Cities.

This repository contains the source code of the Mesophil´s Cities mod as long as it is in beta phase. I decided to split this because I started work on this mod without any Java knowledge by using MCreator and slowly learned as I developed, including more and more custom code. This however, lead to functional, yet very messy and unstructured code, partially Mcreator-generated,  that I´m definitely going to structure and clear up before the mod´s full release.
To make the code already available to the public, I decided to release the beta source code in this separate repository where everyone who really wants to (have fun trying to decrypt this code!) can have a look at the source code while the main repository doesn´t get flooded with unstructured, improvable code.
